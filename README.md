## Introduction

👋 Hi there! I'm Ryan, a finance-turned-biostatistician focused on improving how we use and apply statistical methods in public health and medicine. My journey has evolved from analyzing financial data to focusing on the proper use and application of advanced statistical methods in publich health and medicine.

## My Path

🔄 Career Pivot: I made the leap from finance to biostatistics, driven by a desire to apply my analytical skills to meaningful medical research.

🏥 Recent Project: I've just wrapped up work as a statistical consultant on a retrospective study on pediatric orbital cellulitis in Colorado. This project allowed me to apply techniques like ANCOVA, Poisson Regression, and calculating standardized incidence rates to paint a clear picture of the population affected by this disease.

## What I Bring to the Table

💻 Tech Stack: I'm proficient in R, SAS and Python, using these tools to wrangle data and apply advanced analytical techniques.

📊 Skills: My toolkit includes exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and data visualization. I'm also diving into the world of machine learning to expand my capabilities.

🧠 Approach: I believe in the power of evidence-based healthcare decisions and strive to provide insights that can drive meaningful change.

## What I'm Looking For

🔍 I'm on the hunt for exciting opportunities in biostatistics or data science within the medical research field. 

## Let's Connect!
