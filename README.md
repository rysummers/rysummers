## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Ryan, a finance-turned-biostatistician passionate about improving how statistical methods are applied in public health and medicine. My journey began with analyzing financial data and has since evolved into ensuring the proper use of advanced statistical techniques in medical research.

## My Path

Career Pivot: I made the leap from finance to biostatistics, driven by a desire to apply my analytical skills to meaningful medical research.

Recent Project: Most recently, I worked as a statistical consultant on a retrospective study of pediatric orbital cellulitis in Colorado. This project involved applying methods such as generalized linear mixed models (GzLMM) and calculating standardized incidence rates to provide a clear picture of the affected population.

## What I Bring to the Table

Tech Stack: Proficient in R, SAS, and Python for data wrangling and advanced analysis.

Skills: Experienced in exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and data visualization. Currently expanding into machine learning to broaden my toolkit.

Approach: I believe in evidence-based healthcare decision-making and strive to provide insights that drive meaningful change.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking opportunities in biostatistics and data science, particularly those focused on advancing genetic research.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always eager to learn and grow. If you have suggestions on skills I should add to my repertoire or if you'd like to collaborate, please reach out!
